Automated asset management system

Things to check:

1. How to choose a fair value for alpha in CVAR, may need to try multiple potential values
2. In report, emphasis the model development process (details all of your research and development)
3. Must justify why a optimization model and factor model is selected
4. 一共16个combinations，每个optimization model需要 compare不同variable的效果，*不知道要不要test factor model的input*
5. 最后选表现最好的model
6. outline strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm
7. Remember to add comment to the code, add brief explaination for the function
8. Relate some of the class content to our model in report.
